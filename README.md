# Introduction

Hi, I'm Panki Park.
I'm from South Korea, and I live in Singapore with my beautiful wife and my lovely puppy.
I'm a software engineer, especially specialized in Android development.

I really like to challenge new things such as traveling around the world, and learning new top-notch technologies. I think I enjoy to accomplish something difficult and to learn from failures.

**"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."**
I agree with Thomas Edison's quote.

Welcome you guys :)
